Nevitium - Linux Help File

If you can suggest changes to this documment please forward them to software@datavirtue.com


For users of Gnome desktop environments (Ubuntu and others) you will need to start Nevitium with a script.  You also need Java installed, at least jre version 1.5.0_10

Create a text file (nevstart) and place it in the directory that holds Nevitium

Right-Click the file and select Properties and the Permissions Tab

Enable the Execute property

Put this inside the text file:


nevstart (text file):  <--do not include this 

--------------------------------------------------
1|   cd "/home/sean/Nevitium 1.5/"
2|   /home/sean/jre1.5.0_10/bin/java -jar Nevitium.jar
--------------------------------------------------
(Only the text between the dashes & Do not include the line numbers "1|" & "2|")


Above you can see (on line 2) that I have Java at /home/sean/jre1.5.0_10/bin/

Your Java will be in a different spot, make sure to change that line to reflect the location of Java on your computer.

The actual Java command to launch Nevitium is: java -jar Nevitium.jar

I unzipped Nevitium_1.5.0.zip to: /home/sean/

*********************
[On Ubuntu 7.04+]
TIP: To extract the archive, open it in the Archive Manager (Double-Click), choose the Nevitium 1.5 Folder and Click Extract.  If you Right-Click the file and choose Extract you will have to rename it because it automatically assigns a different name to the extracted folder.
*********************

To Run:
You first have to change to the Nevitium directory as seen on line 1.
The directory is enclosed in quotes because the Nevitium directory (Nevitium 1.5) has a space in it.

So, first we change to the Nevitium directory:
cd "/home/sean/Nevitium 1.5/"

Then we have to run Nevitium:
/home/sean/jre1.5.0_10/bin/java -jar Nevitium.jar


To make a desktop link (launcher) you would point to:
"/home/sean/Nevitium 1.5/nevstart"

Again, you have to use quote marks around the launcher command or you will get an error.  This is because of the space in the path name between Nevitium & 1.5

Right-Click the desktop and select Create Launcher...

Name: Nevitium 1.5
Command: "/home/sean/Nevitium 1.5/nevstart"

Click on the No Icon button to select an icon for your launcher.
I have included a couple small and large .png files perfect for desktop icons.
The icons should be in: "/home/sean/Nevitium 1.5/icons/png/..."
