How To Enable Extended Character Support for languages other than English

Nevitium uses ASCII to store text in the database. This provides a significant performance increase for those using the English Language. If you need extended character support to store text from other languages then you will need to enable UTF or Unicode support. This should allow you to store any characters that you need.

This will not change the language of the text in the program screens however. That is a tanslation issue that is beyond the scope of this feature.

You must enable unicode support before creating databases (companies) in Nevitium. If you do this after creating a compnay and entering data you will not be able to use those data files and you will get errors.

How To:

Look for the encode.char file in your Nevitium install folder.

Open the file and change ASCII to UTF

Don't add anything else, and go ahead and add another blank line by pressing ENTER after the letters UTF.

Save the file.

[You may also want to right-click the file, select properties and make the file read only to prevent changes afterwords.]
