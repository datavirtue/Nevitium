<p style="margin-left: 6"><i>All documents generated by Nevitium are PDF files.&nbsp; A 
PDF is 
a file that stores your document exactly how it will print.&nbsp; You can view 
and print PDF files on any system with a number of programs (freely available); the most popular 
being Adobe Acrobat Reader.&nbsp; It is recommended that you use Adobe Reader 
version 5.0 
or greater to view the documents generated by Nevitium.&nbsp; For more 
information about viewing and printing PDF files from Nevitium see
<a href="settings.html">Output Settings</a>.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left: 6"><i>Do NOT use Adobe Reader 8.0 yet; it is in very bad 
shape right now.&nbsp; Nevitium will not find version 8.0 because it is 
installed in different directories and has a different executable than the 
previous versions over the last ten - twelve years.&nbsp; It is not recommended 
for business use.</i></p>
