      <p style="margin-left: 6">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6"><b>Output Tab</b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6">Click the Output tab and make sure the PDF reader 
      (Adobe) is 
    configured properly.&nbsp; Nevitium tries to configure this automatically 
    for Windows and Linux users.&nbsp; It will also try to select the highest version of 
    Adobe Reader on your machine; most people have several.&nbsp; If you have installed Adobe somewhere other than the default 
    (pic) you will need to configure this manually.&nbsp; Click the <b>
    PDF Reader</b> button and select <b>AcroRd32.exe </b>wherever it may be.&nbsp; 
      Nevitium tries to find &quot;X:\Program Files\Adobe\&quot;&nbsp; where X is the 
      drive you installed Nevitium on.&nbsp; Mac users will have to configure 
      their own PDF reader.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6">
    Next verify the folders listed under the Output 
    section.&nbsp; Nevitium tries to create two folders (pic), one for 
    invoices and one for reports.&nbsp; These folders are where the PDF files 
    will be stored when you generate an invoice or report.&nbsp; This defaults 
    to your home directory; for Windows users this is the My Documents folder. These should 
    be put somewhere convenient.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6">Watermark is an optional setting to spruce up your 
reports.&nbsp; Only select .jpg, .bmp or .gif files no other types will display.&nbsp; 
Try to limit the image size to 300 x 100 (X,Y) points.&nbsp; </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6"><b>Company Information Tab</b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6">Provide some information to make your invoices 
      legal.&nbsp; You should at least fill in the Co Name and full address.&nbsp; 
      If a logo is NOT provided Nevitium will print this information at the top 
      of your invoices in the selected font.&nbsp; If a logo is 
    provided this information will not be printed at the top.&nbsp; Company 
    Contact Information is always printed (logo or not) in a very small font at 
    the bottom of the invoice.&nbsp; Limit the logo area size to about 300 x 100 
    points(X,Y).</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6"><b>Inventory Tab</b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6">Depending upon your coding system for 
    your products you can change the default search field for the Inventory 
    screen.&nbsp; You can always change this on the Inventory screen, this is 
    just the default.&nbsp; Default Markup is a convenience setting to 
    automatically generate a retail Price from the Cost amount entered on the 
    Inventory screen. [Cost * Default Markup Points]&nbsp; After you 
    have entered a Quantity and Cost Nevitium will fill in the retail price.&nbsp; 
    This is easily overridden.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6">Weight Unit needs set to your preferred unit of 
      measurement for inventory weight.&nbsp; The inventory weight field used to 
      be free form but now you should only input decimal numbers without unit 
      designation (no lbs, kgs, etc..).&nbsp; If you measure in Imperial units 
      (lbs) and an item weighs half a pound you would record it as .5 and 
      specify lbs in Settings.&nbsp; </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6"><b>Invoice Tab</b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6">You can set two independent tax rates.&nbsp; 
    You can always toggle the taxes for each item on the Invoice and Inventory 
    screens.&nbsp; Tax1 should be your local sales tax.&nbsp; Tax2 is usually 
    industry specific.&nbsp; </p>
<p style="margin-left: 6">Invoice Prefix: These digits (up to three) can be 
prefixed to your auto-generated invoice numbers.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6">Interest Rate needs set to <b>.00</b> if you do not 
charge interest.&nbsp; The Grace Period prevents an interest charge for X amount 
of days since the invoice is opened.&nbsp;  The interest rate provided is yearly, so it will be divided by 365 before being 
charged against each day past the grace period.&nbsp; Interest is calculated and 
displayed at each payment.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6">The <b>Default Scan Field</b> will set the default (easily 
overridden on the Invoice screen)&nbsp; field to search for items scanned or entered 
in by hand.&nbsp; This is just a default setting, you can select either one on 
the Invoice screen.&nbsp; </p>
<p style="margin-left: 6">If you typically take a payment each time you generate 
an invoice you may want to select the last check box on this tab.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6"><b>Security Tab</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 6">Click the Manage Security button to enable or 
configure security.&nbsp; See <a href="secman.html">Security Manager</a>. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6"><b>Data Files Tab</b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6">The data for Nevitium is fixed in the 
    &quot;data&quot; folder where you installed Nevitium.&nbsp; </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 6">You can also 
    specify primary and secondary <u>default</u> backup folders, the primary can 
    be changed each time you backup; the secondary is always used if it is 
    available.&nbsp;
