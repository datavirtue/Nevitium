      <p style="margin-left: 6">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6"><b>Table View</b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6">The table view displays a browsable list of 
      contacts.&nbsp; Each row can be selected with standard user interface 
      methods; if you don't know how to select individual rows on a table see
      <a target="_blank" href="../tutorials/pdf/nevitium_address.PDF">this 
      tutorial</a>.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6"><b>Filter</b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6">Filter limits the type of contacts that will be 
      displayed in the table view.&nbsp; It is possible to have contacts that 
      are neither customers or suppliers.&nbsp; You will have to select the <b>
      All</b> filter to view these.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6">When you are accessing the Connections screen 
      from Inventory or an Invoice it is setup a bit differently.&nbsp; First 
      the filter is set to Suppliers if accessing from inventory.&nbsp; Secondly 
      it is set to Customers if accessed from the invoice screen.&nbsp; In 
      addition there is a Select button that you must press to send the Contact 
      you highlighted to the invoice or inventory form.&nbsp; Click on one of 
      the rows in the table view and click Select to choose it or click the None 
      button.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6"><b>Find</b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6">To find a certain contact; type some text in the 
      Find field, select the field to search and hit ENTER.&nbsp; You can search 
      on Phone, Last Name, Company, Misc, Zip or Email.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6"><b>Export</b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6">You can do a selective export from the 
      Connections screen.&nbsp; First, select each contact (row) you would like 
      to export.&nbsp; Next hit the export button.&nbsp; You will be asked for a 
      file name; you can select the default if you wish but I would suggest 
      putting it somewhere convenient for you.&nbsp; This export file can be 
      used in other software for mail merges or other types of marketing efforts 
      like faxing.&nbsp; Any records exported to the same file name will be 
      appended instead of overwritten!</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6"><b>Zip Code</b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6">You can use Nevitium to fill in the City and 
      State from the US zip code database by providing a zip code and pressing 
      ENTER or clicking the Zip Code button.&nbsp; You can also enter the city 
      and state and click the Lookup button to fill in the zip code.&nbsp; The 
      Lookup function is not recommended for constant use because of its 
      inaccuracy.&nbsp; Many zip codes are often found for one city name and 
      Nevitium will return the first one it finds.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6"><b>Email</b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6">Pres the email button to launch the address in a 
      new email.&nbsp; This uses your default emai lprogram setup in your 
      operating system.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6"><b>WWW</b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6">Press the www button to launch the web link in a 
      browser.&nbsp; This uses your default browser setup in your operating 
      system.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6"><b>Phone - Fax</b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6">Only 12 characters are saved from the phone and 
      fax fields.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6"><b>Past Invoices</b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6">You can see the past invoices for a client in 
      the small list to the right under the Delete button.&nbsp; Invoices can be 
      viewed and payments can be taken from here.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6"><b>Journal</b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6">Organized notes are kept in the journal.&nbsp; 
      Each day you are allowed to create a new note for each contact if you 
      wish.&nbsp; Past journals can always be viewed or edited.&nbsp; When you 
      click New a journal file for that day is started.&nbsp; You will see it 
      appear in the small window to the left of the journal editor under the New 
      button.&nbsp; Click on a journal entry to view it in the text area on the 
      right.&nbsp; Edit whatever text you wish; when you leave that text window 
      to click on something else it will be saved automatically.</p>
